# Sudoku Solver

This project is under progress.

It has 3 algorithms that I defined based on how I solve a Sudoku.

It takes input from a file called `sud.txt`.

The sudoku should be entered in the file upside down with a "0" for blank spaces.
Each row is a new line and there are no spaces between adjacent cells.
An example of a Sudoku the program can solve has been included.
